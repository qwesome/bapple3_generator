# bapple3_generator
Built to directly make bad apple out of bad apples but it could technically be used for any video file.
(see https://www.tiktok.com/@orsonhitchman/video/7573287862410464528 for an example)
## INSTRUCTIONS
Place bapple.py in the same directory as a file called video.mp4, run it, and it will create output.mp4 after a while.
Not intended for colour video, it will work but it won't make much sense watching the video back

If you want to edit the grid size, replace both instances of '24' in the code.
