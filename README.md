# bapple3_generator
Built to directly make bad apple out of bad apples but it could technically be used for any video file.
(see https://www.tiktok.com/@orsonhitchman/video/7573287862410464528 for an example)
## INSTRUCTIONS
Place bapple.py in the same directory as a file called video.mp4, run it, and it will create output.mp4 after a while.
-# Not intended for colour video, it will work but it won't make much sense watching the video back
